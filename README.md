#### List of all supported kanji

`$ curl https://kanjiapi.dev/v1/kanji/all`

#### List of joyo kanji

`$ curl https://kanjiapi.dev/v1/kanji/joyo` (also `/jouyou`)

JOYO kanji are general use kanji outlined by the Japanese government. The Unihan Database labels four additional kanji as Joyo kanji, bringing the total to 2140 codepoints. Four of the Joyo kanji are missing in the JIS X 0208 encoding, so a different kanji which is present in JIS X 0208 was historically used. Therefore, in the Unihan Database, both the four official kanji and the four JIS X 0208-compatible kanji are marked as Joyo kanji

#### List of jinmeiyo kanji

`$ curl https://kanjiapi.dev/v1/kanji/jinmeiyo` (also `/jinmeiyou`)

#### List of heisig kanji

`$ curl https://kanjiapi.dev/v1/kanji/heisig`

## Development:

### Requirements:

Assumes `python 3`, `make` and `node` are available.

### Setup:

Install python libraries using requirements.txt

Install node dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`.

Save and extract the kanji dictionary file `kanjidic2.xml` from [EDRDG](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project) to the root of the project.

Save and extract the jmdict dictionary file `JMdict` from [EDRDG](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project) to the root of the project.

Save and extract the file Unihan_OtherMappings.txt from Unihan.zip from [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/versions/components-15.0.0.html) to the root of the project.

Ensure system has `System/Library/Fonts/ヒラギノ丸ゴ\ ProN\ W4.ttc` font
available (for favicon generation).

### Building:

Run `make` to build the site and API endpoints as static assets.

Run `python -m pytest tests` to run the tests.

Note: in order to fetch data from the local build of the API from the local
build of the site, you can set the root of your fileserver to out/site (e.g.
with `serveit`: `serveit -s out/site make`). There is a symlink to `out/v1`
inside `out/site` to enable this.

### Deployment (Requires google cloud account credentials):

#### Versioning

The API version for deployment is hardcoded in `api_data.py` and the `makefile`.

After building, to sync the built assets to the website bucket run:

`gsutil -m rsync -c -d out/site gs://kanjiapi.dev` (syncs the built site dir (`out/site`) up with the root of the bucket, but non-recursively)

`gsutil -m -h "Content-Type:application/json" rsync -r -c -d out/v1 gs://kanjiapi.dev/v1` (syncs the built api dir (`out/{version}`) up with the dir `/{version}` in the bucket recursively based on file hashes)

NB: it's a good idea to run both these commands with `rsync -n` for a dry-run first

#### Renewing SSL certificate:

The SSL certificate is only trusted for a certain amount of time, the below script mostly automates
the process of getting a new certificate (requires certbot - `brew install certbot`)

`./update_cert.sh`

#### Setting CORS policy:

The CORS policy is stored in `cors.json`, it can be updated by editing this file and running `gsutil cors set cors.json gs://kanjiapi.dev`
